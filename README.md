# Dependency Injection

In C# and .NET, **`Dependency Injection (DI)`** is a design pattern and a technique that promotes loose coupling between components by injecting dependencies from the outside rather than creating them within the component. ASP.NET Core provides a built-in, flexible DI framework that you can use not only in web applications but also in any .NET Core application.

Here's a basic overview of how you can use Dependency Injection in C# .NET:

1. **`Service Registration`**:
   
In your application's startup code (usually in the **`Startup.cs`** file for ASP.NET Core applications), you register your services with the built-in dependency injection container. This is where you specify the service's implementation and its lifetime (Transient, Scoped, or Singleton).

```csharp
// In ConfigureServices method in Startup.cs
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    // Transient service
    services.AddTransient<ITransientService, TransientService>();

    // Scoped service
    services.AddScoped<IScopedService, ScopedService>();

    // Singleton service
    services.AddSingleton<ISingletonService, SingletonService>();
}

```

2. **`Constructor Injection`**:

In your classes, you can request dependencies through the constructor. The DI container will automatically inject the correct implementation at runtime.

```csharp
public class MyService
{
    private readonly ITransientService transientService;
    private readonly IScopedService scopedService;
    private readonly ISingletonService singletonService;

    public MyService(ITransientService transientService, IScopedService scopedService, ISingletonService singletonService)
    {
        this.transientService = transientService;
        this.scopedService = scopedService;
        this.singletonService = singletonService;
    }

    // ... rest of the class
}

```

3. **`Using Services`**:

Once your services are registered and dependencies injected, you can use them within your application.

```csharp
public class SomeController : Controller
{
    private readonly MyService myService;

    public SomeController(MyService myService)
    {
        this.myService = myService;
    }

    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        // Use myService and its dependencies
        return View();
    }
}

```

Summary:

* **`Service Registration`**: Register your services and their lifetimes in the ConfigureServices method during application startup.

* **`Constructor Injection`**: Request dependencies through the constructor of your classes, and let the DI container provide the implementations.

* **`Scoped Services in Web Applications`**: In web applications, services with a scoped lifetime are typically used to share state within a single HTTP request.

By following these practices, you achieve more maintainable and testable code, as well as better separation of concerns in your application.

# Service Lifetimes

In ASP.NET Core's Dependency Injection (DI) framework, you have three main service lifetimes: Transient, Scoped, and Singleton. Each has its best use cases:

1. **`Transient`**:
* Best used for lightweight, stateless services.
* A new instance is created every time it's requested from the container.
* Suitable for services that don't hold any client-specific state and have a short lifespan.
* Examples include repositories, services that perform a single operation, or stateless utilities.

2. **`Scoped`**:
* Best for services that should be reused within the scope of an HTTP request.
* A single instance is created per HTTP request and shared within that request.
* Ideal for services that need to maintain state or context specific to a request, like a database context.
* Also useful when you want to share an instance among components within a single scope, such as a web API request.

3. **`Singleton`**:
* Use Singleton when you want a single instance of a service to be shared across the entire application.
* The same instance is used throughout the lifetime of the application.
* Typically used for services that are stateless, thread-safe, and should be shared globally, such as configuration settings or caching mechanisms.

Choosing the appropriate service lifetime is essential for optimizing memory usage and ensuring that services behave as expected in different scenarios. It's important to match the service lifetime with the specific requirements of your components and their intended usage.
